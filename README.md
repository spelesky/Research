# Research
This is a code repository for a Search for long-duration local Universe transients and FRB persistent radio source counterparts in the LoTSS DR1 field. Below I include a description of the files included and a summary of the sources being analyzed. 

# Files

SDSSgalaxies.fits: This file contains the SDSS DR16 galaxy data for the galaxies that are within the LoTSS DR1 field that are local under a photometric redshift constraint and with an absolute brightness -16 AB or brighter. 

asu.fit: This file contains LoTSS DR1 radio sources that have an integrated flux $\geq$ 0.8 mJy. 


Note - There is a file containing the LoTSS DR2 radio sources that are in the DR1 field and have an integrated flux $\geq$ 0.8 mJy however the file is too large to add yet so I will have to figure that out. 


plot.ipynb: This is a jupyter notebook that contains the analysis of these final sources being analyzed as well as other calculations done including spectral index, chance association probability, and projected offset. The plots/analysis includes BPT diagrams, WHAN plot, L-SFR plot, sSFR-Mass plot, WISE color-color plot, offset distribution plot with chance association fit, redshift distribution plot, and galaxy contour images. 


Research Sources.xlsx: This is an excel sheet that contains all of the data used in the analysis that is not directly from SDSS DR16 or LoTSS DR1/DR2.
