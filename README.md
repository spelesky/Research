This is a code repository for a search for long-duration local Universe transients and FRB persistent radio source counterparts in the LoTSS DR1 field. Below I include a description of the files included and a summary of the sources being analyzed.

# Summary of Sources:

The current list of candidates includes 39 sources. These 39 sources are radio sources that are compact in both DR1 and DR2 of LoTSS with an average integrated flux of 2.3867 mJy and have been associated with a galaxy from the SDSS galaxy sample with these galaxies having an average redshift of 0.03265. Of these 39 sources, eight of them have offsets larger than 1" from their host galaxy and the remaining 31 have offsets less than 1". Using the emission line data from SDSS DR12, these sources were plotted on BPT diagrams and fall under the star-forming region (not being ruled out as AGN). More emission line data was used to plot these sources on a WHAN diagram where all 39 fall under the star-forming region. These 39 sources also are plotted on a luminosity vs. star-formation rate to show their luminosities are large compared to their SFR and therefore could be a result of something other than SFR. All 39 sources are above the three-sigma line for L-SFR relation which correlates luminosity due to star-formation. Lastly, these 39 sources are plotted on a mass vs. specific star-formation rate and all lie within the star-formation classfication.

So far, all 39 sources are classified as star-forming under these previous analyses. 

Note - There was one source that did not have emission line data for Halpha resulting in it not appearing on the BPT, WHAN, and L-SFR plots. I will look for emission line data in another survey (there was one sent to me however there also was no Haplha data).
